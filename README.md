# Data Manipulation Course

This project contains 30 tasks designed to help beginners learn data manipulation in TypeScript. Each task focuses on different aspects of data transformation using methods like `.map()`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.entries()`, and more.

## Project Structure

- `src/tasks/` - Contains all task implementations
- `src/tests/` - Contains corresponding test files

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

3. Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## How to Complete Tasks

1. Navigate to the task file in `src/tasks/`
2. Implement the empty function according to the task requirements
3. Run the tests to verify your implementation
4. If all tests pass, you've successfully completed the task!

## Available Tasks

The tasks are organized by difficulty level and cover various data manipulation techniques:

1. Basic Array Operations
2. Object Transformations
3. Complex Data Structures
4. Advanced Mapping Techniques

Each task includes:
- A clear description of the requirements
- Example input and expected output
- A test file to validate your solution
